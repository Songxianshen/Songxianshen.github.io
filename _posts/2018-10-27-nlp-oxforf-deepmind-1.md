Natural language text(自然语言文本) = sequences od discrete sysbols(e.g. words)<br/>
<br/>
Naive representation: one hot vectors(独热向量) in $R^{|vocabulary|}$ (very large)<br/>
Classical IR:document and query vectors are superpositions of word vectors.<br/>
Similarly for word classification problems(e.g. naive bayes topicmodels(主题模型))<br/>
Issues:sparse(稀疏), orthogonal representations, semantically weak.
<br/>
richer representations expressing semantic Similarly.<br/>
Idea: produce dense vector representations based on the context/use of words.<br/>
Three main approaches:
  1. count-based(基于计数的)
  2. predictive(预测性的)
  3. task-based(任务型的)


#### count-based methods
1. Define a basis vocabulary C of context words.
2. Define a word window size w.<br/>
目的是将跟目标语义不相关的单词移除窗口。
3. Count the basis vocabulary words occurring w words to the left or right or right of each instance of a target word in the corpus.(统计在目标词汇的两侧窗口(w的词距)中基本词出现的次数)
4. From a vector representation of the target word based on these counts(并将这个数量表示为矢量).
5. Use inner produce or cosine as similarly kernel.(e.g. cosine)

cosine has the advantage that it's a norm-invariant metric.<br/>
<br/>
issues:not all features are equal<br/>
<br/>
Many normalization methods(来自于统计学的适量标准化方法): TF-IDF, PMI, etc.<br/>
Some remove the need for norm-invariant similarly metrics.<br/>


#### Neural Embedding models(神经词向量模型)
Learning count based vectors produces an embedding matrix in $R^{|vocabulary|}$<br/>
raw = word vectors<br/>
symbols = unique vectors<br/>
representation = embedding symbols with E<br/>
<br/>
one generic idea behind embedding learning:<br/>
![generic](/images/DL-images/nlp-deepmind-ox-1.png)
1. collect insatnces
2. for each instance, collect it's context words
3. define some score function score with upper bound on output
4. define a loss<br/>
easy to design a useless scorer(e.g. ignore input, output upper bound).<br/>

ideally, score:
* embeds t with E(obviously).评分函数要明显的用到优化后的词向量矩阵t,并得到一个表征。
* produces a score which is a function of how well t is accounted for by c.得出的分数要有说明性。
* requires the word to account for the context (or the reverse) more than another word in the same place.评价上下文可以将单词解释的怎么样，反映在自然语言中的使用情况怎么样。
* produces a loss which is differentiable w.r.t. theta and E.

5. estimate E
6. use the estimate E as your embedding matrix
